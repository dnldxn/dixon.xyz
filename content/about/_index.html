  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I'm Daniel.  I'm currently a Senior Data Engineer at Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), where I work in the Payments and Fraud group.  I have 12+ years of distributed computing experience. I am a strong information technology professional skilled in Apache Spark, Python, AWS, and SQL.</p>

  <p>Prior to joining Sony, I spent 7 years at Wells Fargo as a distributed big-data engineer within the Data Science and Fraud teams.  My role was creating scalable data pipelines, which would combine and transform terabytes of raw data to feed into machine learning models.  I was also involved in integrating those ML models with production systems to enable real-time decisioning.</p>

  <p>Before Wells Fargo, I spent 4 years as a Business Intelligence consultant at Teradata, with a focus on visualization and ETL pipelines.  During this time I got to work with some big companies across various industries, travelled a bunch, and learned a ton.</p>

  <p>I am passionate about building robust and performant data pipelines, transforming raw data to feed into intelligent applications.</p>

  <p>I graduated from Georgia Tech (go Jackets!) with degrees in Electrical Engineer and Computer Science.</p>

  <h1 class="mt-5">More About Me</h1>

  <p>In my free time I love training for endurance events, including long-distance Ironman, triathlons, and marathons.  I live just outside of San Diego with the world's two cutest dogs (seriously, they are).</p>
